# E-Commerce-Sales

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The dataset includes information on various product categories, sales figures, purchase addresses, and the time of sales transactions. Key metrics such as total sales, quantity ordered, and price per item are evaluated to understand the performance of different product categories like Laptops and Computers, Home Appliances, and Monitors.

The project utilizes Tableau dashboards to visualize data trends over time, by product category, and across different regions, facilitating decision-making for inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer targeting. Insights derived from this analysis help improve operational efficiency and enhance the customer shopping experience.

Future scope includes leveraging advanced analytics techniques such as machine learning to predict customer preferences and optimize inventory, as well as integrating real-time data to support dynamic pricing strategies and personalized marketing.
